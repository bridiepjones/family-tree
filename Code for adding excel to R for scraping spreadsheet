//you need to convert excel to CSV first or save as "csv" //
df = read.table("family.csv", header = TRUE) // replace family.csv with your filename

Copy and paste from Excel to R

df = read.table("clipboard")

Add ODBC connection

require(RODBC)
conn = odbcConnectExcel("family.xlsx") # open a connection to the Excel file
sqlTables(conn)$TABLE_NAME # show all sheets
df = sqlFetch(conn, "Sheet1") # read a sheet
df = sqlQuery(conn, "select * from [Sheet1 $]") # read a sheet (alternative SQL sintax)
close(conn) # close the connection to the file

RSPLUS

require(gdata)
df = read.xls ("family.xlsx"), sheet = 1, header = TRUE)

xlsReadWrite package (windows only)

require(xlsReadWrite)
xls.getshlib()
df = read.xls("family.xls", sheet = 1)

XLConnect package (java based)

require(XLConnect)
wb = loadWorkbook("myfile.xlsx")
df = readWorksheet(wb, sheet = "Sheet1", header = TRUE)

require(xlsx)
coln = function(x) { # A function to see column numbers
  y = rbind(seq(1, ncol(x)))
  colnames(y) = colnames(x)
  rownames(y) = "col.number"
  return(y)
}
data = read.xlsx2("myfile.xlsx", 1) # open the file 
coln(data) # check the column numbers you want to have as factors
x = 3 # Say you want columns 1-3 as factors, the rest numeric
data = read.xlsx2("myfile.xlsx", 1, 
  colClasses = c(rep("character", x), rep("numeric", ncol(data)-x+1))
)
